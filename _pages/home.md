I'm a PhD candidate at [Technion](https://www.technion.ac.il/en/home-2/), in the [Electrical and Computer Engineering Faculty](https://ece.technion.ac.il/) under the supervision of [Prof. Ittay Eyal](https://webee.technion.ac.il/people/ittay/) and [Prof. Aviv Tamar](https://avivt.github.io/avivt/).
In addition, I'm a member of the [Technion Hiroshi Fujiwara Cyber Security Research Center](https://cyber.technion.ac.il/) and the [Initiative for Cryptocurrencies & Contracts](https://www.initc3.org/).

My research interests include blockchain protocols and reinforcement learning.
The goal of my research is to ensure the security of blockchain protocols.
I mainly analyze incentive compatibilty, i.e., trying to understand whether miners are incentivized to behave as intended.
This is a crucial security aspect of blockchains due to their anonymous and distributed nature.
To perform my analyses, I utilize state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning to find optimal mining strategies.

I received my BSc (Cum Laude) in applied mathematics from [Bar-Ilan University](https://www.biu.ac.il/en) and my MSc (Cum Laude) in computer science from Technion.
